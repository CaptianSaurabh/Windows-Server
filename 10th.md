What is an RDP License Server?

A Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) License Server is a server that manages and distributes Remote Desktop Services (RDS) licenses to clients that connect to a Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) server. The RDP License Server is responsible for tracking and enforcing the number of concurrent connections to the RDSH server, ensuring that the organization complies with Microsoft's licensing terms.

How does an RDP License Server work?

Here's a step-by-step overview of how an RDP License Server works:

RDSH Server Configuration: The RDSH server is configured to use the RDP License Server. The RDSH server is the server that hosts the remote desktop sessions.
Client Connection: A client (e.g., a user's computer) initiates a connection to the RDSH server using RDP.
License Request: The RDSH server sends a license request to the RDP License Server.
License Availability: The RDP License Server checks if there are available licenses in the license pool.
License Issuance: If a license is available, the RDP License Server issues a license to the RDSH server, which then grants the client access to the remote desktop session.
License Tracking: The RDP License Server tracks the issued license and updates the license count.
License Expiration: When the client disconnects from the RDSH server, the license is returned to the license pool, and the RDP License Server updates the license count.
Types of RDP Licenses

There are two types of RDP licenses:

Per-Device CAL: A Per-Device CAL is assigned to a device (e.g., a computer) and allows multiple users to access the RDSH server from that device.
Per-User CAL: A Per-User CAL is assigned to a user and allows that user to access the RDSH server from any device.
RDP License Server Installation and Configuration

To install and configure an RDP License Server, follow these general steps:

Install the Remote Desktop Licensing role on a Windows Server.
Activate the license server using a license key.
Configure the license server to use a specific license mode (e.g., Per-Device CAL or Per-User CAL).
Add licenses to the license pool.
Configure the RDSH server to use the RDP License Server.
PowerShell Code

You can use PowerShell to manage and configure the RDP License Server. Here's an example of how to add licenses to the license pool:

powershell

Import-Module RemoteDesktop
Add-RDLicense -LicenseServer <LicenseServerName> -LicenseType <PerDeviceCAL or PerUserCAL> -LicenseCount <NumberofLicenses>
