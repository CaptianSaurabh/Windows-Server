Let's cover some basic knowledge about Linux servers.

Assigning an IP Address to a Linux Server

To assign an IP address to a Linux server, you'll need to edit the network configuration file. The steps may vary depending on the Linux distribution you're using. Here are the general steps for some popular distributions:

Ubuntu/Debian

Edit the /etc/network/interfaces file using a text editor like nano or vim.
Add the following lines to configure the IP address:

# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.1.100
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.1.1
  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
CentOS/RHEL

Edit the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file using a text editor like nano or vim.
Add the following lines to configure the IP address:


DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.1.100
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
DNS1=8.8.8.8
DNS2=8.8.4.4
Restarting the Network Service

After editing the network configuration file, you'll need to restart the network service for the changes to take effect. You can do this using the following command:

bash

sudo service networking restart
or

bash

sudo systemctl restart network
Hostname Configuration

To configure the hostname on a Linux server, you can use the hostname command. Here's an example:

bash

sudo hostnamectl set-hostname myserver
This will set the hostname to myserver. You can verify the hostname using the hostname command:

bash

hostname
This should display the new hostname.

Basic Linux Server Commands

Here are some basic Linux server commands you should know:

ssh: Secure Shell, used to remotely access the server.
sudo: Super User DO, used to execute commands with elevated privileges.
cd: Change Directory, used to navigate through the file system.
ls: List, used to display the contents of a directory.
mkdir: Make Directory, used to create a new directory.
rm: Remove, used to delete files and directories.
cp: Copy, used to copy files and directories.
mv: Move, used to move or rename files and directories.
These are just some of the basic commands you'll need to get started with managing a Linux server. Of course, there are many more commands and concepts to learn, but this should give you a good starting point!
