Active directory domain services and Group policy (Knowledge of FSMO, certificate and GPO).

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Group Policy are two fundamental components of a Windows-based network infrastructure. Here's an overview of each, including FSMO, certificate, and GPO:

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

AD DS is a role in Windows Server that provides a centralized repository for storing information about objects on a network, such as users, groups, computers, and printers. It allows administrators to manage and authenticate users, computers, and other resources on the network.

Key Components of AD DS:

Domain Controllers (DCs): These are servers that run AD DS and store a copy of the Active Directory database.
Domain: A logical grouping of computers and users that share a common directory database.
Tree: A hierarchical structure of domains that share a common namespace.
Forest: A collection of trees that share a common schema and global catalog.
Flexible Single Master Operations (FSMO) Roles:

FSMO roles are specialized roles assigned to domain controllers to ensure consistency and availability of Active Directory data. There are five FSMO roles:

Schema Master: Responsible for updating the schema of the forest.
Domain Naming Master: Responsible for adding and removing domains from the forest.
RID Master: Responsible for allocating RIDs (Relative IDs) to domain controllers.
PDC Emulator: Responsible for emulating a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) for backward compatibility.
Infrastructure Master: Responsible for updating the group membership and SID (Security Identifier) history.

Certificates:

Certificates are used to establish secure connections between clients and servers. In AD DS, certificates are used for:

Secure authentication: Certificates are used to authenticate users and computers.
Encryption: Certificates are used to encrypt data transmitted between clients and servers.
Digital signatures: Certificates are used to verify the authenticity of data.

Group Policy (GPO):

Group Policy is a feature of AD DS that allows administrators to define and enforce policies for users and computers on the network. GPOs are used to:

Configure security settings: GPOs can be used to configure security settings, such as password policies and account lockout policies.
Deploy software: GPOs can be used to deploy software to users and computers.
Configure desktop settings: GPOs can be used to configure desktop settings, such as wallpaper and screensaver settings.

Key Components of GPO:

Group Policy Object (GPO): A container that holds a set of policies.
Group Policy Template (GPT): A template that defines the structure and content of a GPO.
Group Policy Editor (GPE): A tool used to create and edit GPOs.
GPO Processing:

GPOs are processed in the following order:

Local Group Policy: GPOs are applied to the local computer.
Site Group Policy: GPOs are applied to the site.
Domain Group Policy: GPOs are applied to the domain.
Organizational Unit (OU) Group Policy: GPOs are applied to the OU.
In summary, AD DS provides a centralized repository for storing information about objects on a network, while Group Policy allows administrators to define and enforce policies for users and computers on the network. Understanding FSMO roles, certificates, and GPOs is essential for managing and maintaining a Windows-based network infrastructure.
