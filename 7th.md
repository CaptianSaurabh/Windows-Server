Esxi, Venter (need to know VM and VM files, stander switch and distributed switch, HA, DRS, FT, snapshot, clone, template, datastore and share data store)


You want to know about various concepts related to VMware ESXi and vCenter. Here's an overview of each topic you mentioned:

1. VM and VM files

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer.
VM files are the files that make up a VM, including:
.vmx (VM configuration file)
.vmdk (VM disk file)
.vmxf (VM firmware file)
.nvram (VM BIOS settings file)
.vmsd (VM snapshot metadata file)
2. Standard Switch and Distributed Switch

A Standard Switch (also known as a vSwitch) is a virtual network switch that allows VMs to communicate with each other and the physical network.
A Distributed Switch (also known as a dvSwitch) is a virtual network switch that spans multiple ESXi hosts, allowing for more advanced networking features and easier management.
3. HA (High Availability)

HA is a feature that ensures VMs are always available, even in the event of an ESXi host failure.
HA works by creating a cluster of ESXi hosts, where VMs can be automatically restarted on another host if one fails.
4. DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler)

DRS is a feature that dynamically allocates and reallocates resources (such as CPU and memory) to VMs based on their utilization.
DRS helps to ensure that VMs are running efficiently and that resources are not wasted.
5. FT (Fault Tolerance)

FT is a feature that allows a VM to continue running even if the underlying ESXi host fails.
FT works by creating a duplicate copy of the VM on another ESXi host, which can take over immediately if the primary host fails.
6. Snapshot

A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a VM's state, including its disk and memory contents.
Snapshots can be used to roll back a VM to a previous state, or to create a clone of a VM.
7. Clone

A clone is a copy of a VM, including its disk and memory contents.
Clones can be used to create multiple identical VMs, or to create a backup of a VM.
8. Template

A template is a pre-configured VM that can be used to create new VMs.
Templates can include a base operating system, applications, and other settings.
9. Datastore

A datastore is a storage repository for VM files, such as .vmdk files.
Datastores can be local (on the ESXi host) or shared (on a SAN or NAS device).
10. Shared Datastore

A shared datastore is a datastore that is shared across multiple ESXi hosts.
Shared datastores allow VMs to be easily migrated between hosts, and can improve storage utilization.
Here is some sample PowerCLI code to get you started with some of these concepts:

powershell

# Get a list of all VMs
Get-VM

# Create a new VM
New-VM -Name "MyNewVM" -Template "MyTemplate" -Datastore "MyDatastore"

# Take a snapshot of a VM
Get-VM -Name "MyVM" | New-Snapshot -Name "MySnapshot"

# Clone a VM
Get-VM -Name "MyVM" | New-VM -Name "MyClone" -Location "MyFolder"

# Create a new standard switch
New-VirtualSwitch -Name "MySwitch" -Type Standard

# Create a new distributed switch
New-VirtualSwitch -Name "MyDvSwitch" -Type Distributed
Note: This is just a brief overview of each topic, and there is much more to learn about each one.
