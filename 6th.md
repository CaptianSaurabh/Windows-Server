Server and endpoints patching through wsus and tool like SECM and manage engine

Server and endpoint patching can be achieved through WSUS (Windows Server Update Services) and tools like SECM (Security and Compliance Management) and ManageEngine.

WSUS is a Microsoft tool that allows administrators to manage and deploy updates to Windows-based computers. However, it has some limitations, such as being inefficient, cumbersome, and buggy at times. Additionally, WSUS provides only rudimentary automation and little in the way of reporting capabilities.

To address these limitations, third-party patching tools like SECM and ManageEngine can be used. These tools can help streamline and simplify patching operations, while providing greater control over the patching process.

Some other tools that can be used for server and endpoint patching are:

Ivanti Security Controls: an enterprise-grade tool that can patch Windows and Linux machines, as well as VMware ESXi hosts and Windows applications.
Kaseya VSA: a cloud-based remote monitoring and management service that includes patch management capabilities for Windows, macOS, and Linux machines.
Automox: a cloud-based, cross-platform system management tool that can be used for patch management, software distribution, reporting, and policy enforcement.
These tools can provide features such as automated patch deployment, scheduling, and reporting, as well as granular control over the patching process.

Here is an example of how you might use PowerShell to automate patch deployment with Ivanti Security Controls:

powershell

# Import the Ivanti Security Controls module
Import-Module -Name IvantiSecurityControls

# Define the patch deployment settings
$patchSettings = @{
    "PatchDeployment" = @{
        "Schedule" = "Daily"
        "Time" = "02:00"
    }
}

# Deploy patches to all machines
Get-Machine | Deploy-Patch -Settings $patchSettings
